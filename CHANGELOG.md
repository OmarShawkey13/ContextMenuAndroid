# Changelog

## [1.0.7] - 2025-12-22

### 🚀 Enhancements & Fixes

- ⚡️ **Performance & Stability**: Enhanced performance and stability of the package.
- 🎯 **SDK Update**: Updated minimum Dart SDK requirement to **^3.10.4**.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-12-05

### 🛠 Bug fixes & Quality Improvements

- 🐛 **Fixed** layout overflow in nested submenus when used inside constrained parents (e.g., `Row`/`Column`) by improving parent-data checks and enforcing proper `Flexible` placement.
- 🧩 **Resolved** animation stutter caused by simultaneous `childController` / `menuController` conflicts — added improved sequencing and cancellation logic.
- ✅ **Guarded** navigation pops with extra `mounted` checks to prevent exceptions when widget tree is being disposed.
- 🔒 **Stabilized** internal state updates to avoid duplicate callbacks on fast successive taps.

### ✨ New Features

- 🔀 **New parameter: `menuAlignment`**
    - Adds flexible control over menu alignment and opening direction (e.g., `left`, `right`, `center`, `start`, `end`).
    - Works with screen-edge detection to flip direction automatically when needed.
    - Example: `ContextMenuAndroid(menuAlignment: MenuAlignment.right)` to force right alignment.

### 🚀 UX & Animation

- 🎞 Improved close animation timing to better match opening velocity (smoother reverse transitions).
- ↔️ Enhanced submenu slide transitions to better respect `menuAlignment` and RTL layouts.
- ✨ Slightly increased backdrop blur radius with adaptive opacity for clearer readability in bright/dark backgrounds.

### 🧭 API & Developer Experience

- 🎯 Updated minimum Dart SDK requirement to **^3.10.1** for improved performance, language features, and compatibility.


- 🧰 Added `MenuAlignment` enum to public API with clear docs and examples.
- 🧾 Updated example app showing `menuAlignment` usage and RTL support example.
- 🧪 Added additional unit tests around submenu stack restoration and alignment flipping.

### 🧹 Code Maintenance

- 🔁 Refactored `getResponsiveSize()` to centralize min/max clamps for consistent behavior across versions.
- 🧼 Removed deprecated internal helpers and improved doc comments (Arabic + English).
- 📦 Minor dependency bumps and lint fixes.

## [1.0.5] - 2025-11-05

### 🚀 Major Improvements

#### 🧩 Animation & Performance Enhancements
- ⚙️ **Optimized animation lifecycle** — old `AnimationController` instances are now properly disposed to prevent memory leaks.
- 🕒 Adjusted animation duration dynamically (`min(600, 80 * length)`) for smoother scaling on long action lists.
- 🔁 Added **reverse closing animation** when dismissing the menu for a more natural experience.
- 🧠 Improved animation sequencing between `childController` and `menuController` for iOS-like smooth transitions.

#### 🧭 Submenu UX Improvements
- ➕ Added **visual arrow indicator (`chevron_right`)** for items that contain submenus.
- 🔙 Enhanced back-navigation with animated slide transitions and proper stack restoration.

#### 🎨 UI / Layout Refinements
- 🪟 Added **SafeArea** to protect against notch and gesture areas.
- 🧱 Wrapped long menus in `SingleChildScrollView` with `Flexible` to prevent overflow on small devices.
- 💡 Improved background blur with a subtle dark overlay (`Colors.black.withOpacity(0.15)`) for better contrast.
- ⚖️ Refined menu width and padding using responsive scaling.

#### 🧮 Responsive Design Enhancements
- 📏 Improved `getResponsiveSize()` — now clamps width between `320.0` and `600.0` for better tablet support.
- 📱 Ensures consistent sizing across all devices, maintaining proportional text and padding.

#### 🧰 Codebase Cleanup & Reliability
- ✅ Added defensive checks for mounted state before popping navigation.
- 🧼 Refactored logic to make the widget **production-stable** for large projects.
- 📄 Preserved all inline documentation and bilingual comments for clarity.

## [1.0.4] - 2025-07-22

### 🆕 Features

#### 🍔 SubMenu Support
- ✅ Added support for nested `subMenu` items in context menu.
- 📱 Submenus open with **iOS-style sliding animation**.
- 🔙 Includes automatic "Back" button and navigation stack handling.
- 🎯 Fully animated using `AnimatedSwitcher` with slide transitions.

---

## [1.0.3] - 2025-07-18

### 🎯 Enhancements

#### 📏 Responsive Sizing Added
- ✅ New `textSize` and `iconSize` properties allow for per-device scaling.
- ✅ Sizes are automatically adjusted using `getResponsiveSize()` to match screen width for consistent appearance across devices.

#### 🧠 Smarter Style Composition
- ✨ Introduced `getTextStyle()` helper to merge user-defined `textStyle` with fallback logic and responsive sizing.
- ✨ Introduced `getIconColor()` for consistent icon coloring logic (including automatic detection of delete actions).

#### 🧾 Internal Improvements
- 💬 Added inline documentation and bilingual comments (Arabic + English) for better clarity and future maintenance.
- 📦 Padding is now responsive by default using `getResponsiveSize()` (e.g., horizontal padding `16 → getResponsiveSize(16)`).

## [1.0.2] - 2025-07-17

### ✅ Fixes & Improvements
